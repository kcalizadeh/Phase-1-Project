# Phase-1-Project
A repository for work on the Flatitons School Phase 1 Project

This repo contains 3 primary documents:\n
1 A Jupyter Notebook containing code and explanations for the movie data and results
2 A slide deck presentation that summarizes that data for a non-technical audience
3 A presentation recording where I go over the findings
You will also find two folders - one is the movie data zipped, and the other is an empty folder where unzipped files will be generated.

Our primary goal was to decide what kind of movie to make for our newly minted Microsoft Stuidios. To decide this, we looked at 5 primary questions:
Q1 What kind of budget should we have?
Q2 Do ratings matter, or can we ignore them?
Q3 What genre of film should we make?
Q4 Who should our director be?
Q5 Who should our writer(s) be?

Our answers:
Q1 - it turns out that higher budgets yield higher profits. We recommend a budget of $4M, with an expected rate of return of 25-40%
Q2 - there is no meaningful connection between ratings and profits
Q3 - animation, adventure, and sci-fi are the most profitable
Q4 - Pierre Coffin is has the highest average profits. He works primarily with children's films, however, so another director like Christopher Nolan or Michael Bay would be ideal
Q5 - Joe Simon or Joss Whedon are the recommended hires based on the average profits of their films

Code and explanation can be found in the Jupyter Notebook
